This is one of my pentesting projects that was completed during my Cyber security bootcamp experience.
As a new Cyber security enthusiast, this project gave me tons of experience with pentesting a web application, Linux servers and Windows servers.
Like I said in the second line above I am new to the Cyber security world, so this pentest report may not be perfect, so please bear with on that!
